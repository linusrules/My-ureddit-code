All these programs are better implementations than 005/cwr.py  
I want to know the timings for different codes

cwr_001.py and cwr_002.py differ in the WordsIndex class. 
cwr_003.py and cwr_004.py elimminates unnecesary solution.pop() lines
cwr_003.py creates a list per solution
cwr_004.py creates only one list for all solutions

Examples
python cwr_001.py
python cwr_002.py
python cwr_003.py
python cwr_004.py
