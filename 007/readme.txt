puzzle_solver.py resolves 3 x 3 sudokus
puzzle_solver_9.py, puzzle_solver_9a.py and puzzle_solver_9b.py are buggy slow code.

sudoku_4x4 and sudoku_9x9.py is faster code, and runs ok.

sudoku_9x9_a.py and sudoku_9x9_b.py test the 9x9 example from the lecture 7.

sudoku_9x9_a.py is the fast version
sudoku_9x9_b.py tests why the 9x9 example, lecture 7, can not be solved. 
The algorithm fails at the second row, sixth column.
